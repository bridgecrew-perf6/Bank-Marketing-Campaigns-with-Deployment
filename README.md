## Overview
This projects aims to create a cloud-based machine learning model for the Bank Marketing Dataset, which contains data about marketing campaigns for a bank, to create this model we will utilize the power of AutoML for this classification problem to be able to predict whether a bank product would be subscribed by the client or not.  
The project involves configuring, deploying and consuming the model.
The project also includes creating, consuming and publishing an ML Pipeline.
